# Academic Data Analytics Projects
This repository contains a curated set of academic projects that demonstrate my foundation in data analytics, business intelligence, relational database design, and applied machine learning.

The projects included here have been refined to focus on real-world problem framing, analytical thinking, and clear communication of insights rather than coursework submission requirements. Each project includes a concise explanation of the business or analytical objective, the approach taken, and the key outcomes.

These projects represent my academic grounding and complement my professional experience in analytics and data-driven problem solving.
