# Overview

This project analyzes the historical stock performance and financial trends of NVIDIA Corporation using R. The objective was to explore price movements, returns, volatility patterns, and overall growth behavior over time, and to derive insights from exploratory financial data analysis.

The final output is a structured analytical report generated using R Markdown, combining visualizations, statistical summaries, and financial interpretation.

# Objective

* Analyze NVIDIA’s historical stock price trends
* Examine daily returns and volatility patterns
* Evaluate long-term growth behavior
* Visualize moving averages and trend signals
* Generate an integrated analytical report using reproducible R workflows

# Dataset

The dataset includes historical stock market data for NVIDIA Corporation, such as:

* Date
* Open price
* High price

# Key Results

* Identified strong long-term upward momentum with periods of elevated volatility
* Observed clustering of high-volatility periods during market-wide events
* Moving average crossovers highlighted short- and long-term trend shifts

# Key Insight

Stock price growth often comes with significant volatility. Time-series visualization combined with return analysis provides a clearer understanding of risk-return trade-offs in high-growth technology stocks.
