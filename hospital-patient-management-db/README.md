# Hospital Patient Management System (Relational Database Design)

## Objective
Design a normalized relational database to support core hospital operations including patient records, appointments, treatments, medications, and billing.

## Scope

## Approach
* Designed a 13-table relational schema normalized to third normal form
* Implemented primary and foreign key relationships to ensure data integrity
* Modeled real-world healthcare workflows such as visits, treatments, and billing
* Wrote SQL queries to support operational reporting and data retrieval

## Key Features
* Proper handling of one-to-many and many-to-many relationships
* Clear separation of entities such as patients, providers, visits, and medications
* Query examples demonstrating joins, aggregations, and filtering

## Relevance
This project demonstrates enterprise-style data modeling and SQL querying skills commonly required for analytics roles that work closely with transactional systems.

## Tools
SQL, Relational Database Design, Data Modeling
