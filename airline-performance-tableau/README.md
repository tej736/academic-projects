# Airline Performance Analytics Dashboard (Tableau)

## Overview 
This project analyzes airline operational performance and ticket pricing patterns using Tableau. The goal was to explore how airlines differ across travel time, stoppages, departure activity, pricing strategies, and market presence, and to surface patterns that support comparative and exploratory analysis across carriers and airports.

The final output is an interactive Tableau dashboard designed to support airline performance benchmarking and operational insights.

## Objective
* Analyze airline travel behavior across different flight durations and routes
* Compare ticket pricing distributions across major airlines
* Identify high-traffic departure airports and dominant carriers
* Examine stoppage frequency and waiting time patterns
* Enable interactive exploration using filters and parameters

## Dataset
The dataset contains flight-level airline performance data, including:

* Airline name
* Ticket price
* Total travel time
* Number of stoppages
* Total stoppage (waiting) time
* Departure airport
* Departure time span (morning, afternoon, evening, night)

The data was structured to support airline-level, airport-level, and route-level analysis.

## Approach
* Cleaned and validated flight-level data to ensure consistency across pricing, time, and airport fields
* Created calculated fields in Tableau to derive travel time, stoppage metrics, and pricing aggregates
* Designed multiple analytical views focusing on airline efficiency, pricing behavior, and airport activity
* Integrated all views into a single interactive dashboard with dynamic filters and parameters
